Introduction
---

This is a simple script that provides a formula to retrieve the price of a crypto and a menu with a button to update all the formulas at once.

To avoid hitting the CoinMarketCap free plan limits, adding each individual formula does not make a request, but instead displays a dummy text in the formula value.

When you have finished adding all the formulas, click the update button on the menu and a single request is made to retrieve all the prices and update the formulas.

---
Usage
---

Use this formula where you want to retrieve the price of a crypto.

```
=CMCPRICE("KUMA")
```

By default it displays a text before fetching the price from the API, if you are using it within a more complex formula and you don't want to trigger an error, you can add a temporary value, it will be updated later.

```
=CMCPRICE("KUMA", 1)
```

After placing all the formulas, just go to the menÃº and click on "CoinMarketCap" > "Update".
